# DIS_Assignment1
Made a website from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It contains some basic information about me, my hobbies, my projects, etc. 

So do visit my website https://nimisha2001.github.io/DIS_Assignment1/ if you wish to know more about me. I have used various animations and hyperlinks to make the website visually appealing and interesting.
